# MONGOOSE & MONGO DB

This repo is meant to be a resource for me (and hopefully others) for developing in Mongoose.
As I was learning the stack, I found it difficult to understand the stack and I wanted to create notes to refer to while working with Mongoose & Mongo DB. For beginners, I strongly recommend reading the book 'Mongoose for Application Development' by Simon Holmes [Packt Publishing]. That was one of the few books I managed to find that went into great detail about using Mongoose. Since it was released in 2013, Im hoping to update some of the outdated information from the book and publish them here based on the Mongoose API documentation. If any information is inaccurate or you would like to contribute some content, feel free to raise an issue and we can integrate content using pull requests.

### The Technology Stack - Node.js, npm, MongoDB, and Express

For a long time, JS was mainly perceived as a browser-based scripting language.

However on May 27, 2009, a developer by the name of Ryan Dahl released the very first version of Node.js.
Node.js was a new server side system that enabled the usage of JavaScript on the server side.

Most web developers saw this as an interesting development since they didn't have to learn a new language from scratch for the back-end and they could also share some code between the front-end and the back-end. For example, form validation is usally done on browser and server and with Node JS, you could use the same code for both sides.
